# Project Neurogenesis

Project concept is to create an architecture capable of generating new neurons on the fly to capture higher-level associations. It is believed that certain parts of the adult brain experience neurogenesis. It is theorized that neurogenesis facilitates the brain's ability to process/accept novel stimulii.
